### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Engineer, currently working on Large Language Models.

Before then, I lead research for representation learning on graphs at the **Huawei Munich Research Center**.

I hold a PhD in Machine Learning from the **University of Oxford**, funded by an **Oxford-Deepmind** scholarship. There I studied adversarial examples for deep neural networks and how to evaluate computer vision systems based on sensors-perception, with the goal of finding sounder ways to improve machine learning robustness.

You can find a list of my publications on ðŸŽ“[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EiuXVMsAAAAJ).
