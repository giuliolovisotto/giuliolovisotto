### Hi there 👋

I am a Machine Learning Researcher at the **Huawei Munich Research Center**, where I'm 🔭 currently working on representation learning on temporal graphs.

Before that, I completed my 👨‍🎓 PhD at the **University of Oxford**, funded by an **Oxford-Deepmind** scholarship. In my dissertation, I studied adversarial examples for deep neural networks and how to evaluate the security of systems based on sensors-perception, with the goal of finding sounder ways to evaluate and improve machine learning robustness.

During my PhD, I was lucky enough to collaborate with 🏭 industrial partners, including **Mastercard**, the armasuisse **Cyber-Defence Campus**, and to spend some time at the **Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence Research**, where I investigated the [robustness of Transformers](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Lovisotto_Give_Me_Your_Attention_Dot-Product_Attention_Considered_Harmful_for_Adversarial_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf) for vision tasks, under the supervision of Jan Hendrik Metzen.

You can find a list of my publications on 🎓[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EiuXVMsAAAAJ).
